![Test](https://github.com/farmersdog/clubhouse-pr/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

Automatically update your Github Pull Request with data from your clubhouse story in the format: `(feat) Some Feature [ch123]`. Also adds the clubhouse story's URL to the beginning of the body of your PR.

This action is configured to extract the clubhouse story id form either the branch or title. It works best if you use the builtin [git helpers](https://help.clubhouse.io/hc/en-us/articles/207540323-Using-Branches-and-Pull-Requests-with-the-Clubhouse-VCS-Integrations) to generate your branch names.

## Inputs

### `ghToken`

**Required** GITHUB_TOKEN

### `chToken`

**Required** Clubhouse API Token

### `addStoryType`

**Optional** Boolean to enable or disable prepending the story type to the PR title

**Default** `true`

### `useStoryNameTrigger`

**Optional** When a PR is opened with this string as the title, fetch the story name from clubhouse

**Default** `ch`

## Outputs

### `prTitle`

The title of the pull request

## Development

Run `yarn tdd` to watch Jest tests as you make your changes.

Run `yarn lint:watch` to watch for ESLint errors/warnings.

**Note**: Always run `yarn build` before pushing any changes.
